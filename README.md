# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
For this analysis, our purpose is to analyze credit risk from data generated from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Using the scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn libraries, we are evaluating models using resampling. We are also oversampling the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, as well as undersampling the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then we combine these approaches by using the SMOTEENN algorithm. And finally, to reduce bias, we are using two machine learning models: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
